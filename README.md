# Readme

This README should be completed by the student


## Prepare the content

Readme files are made for developers (including you), but also could be used for the final users.
So while you are writing your readme files please consider a few things:

1. What is about?
    - Your name and student number and course name on the top
    - Describe the content of your project or repository
    - Explain things the users would have a hard time understanding right away
2. What steps need to be taken?
    - Any specific steps for running your application, what is the main class?
    - Is there any requirements or dependencies?
    - After the installation, how they compile or run the code?
3. Execution examples
    - You could provide examples of execution with code and screenshots
    

other things you could add:

- Table of content
- Test cases
- Know bugs
- Things that have not been working or complete
